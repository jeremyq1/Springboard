The csv file stated with 330 rows and I have cut it down to 277 rows. The data wrangling process included looking for duplicate entires, sorting for null values, and searching for large outliers using distribution tables sch as bargraphs, histograms, and box-and-wisker plots. For entires that looked unrealistic, I checked on the internet to verify its accuracy and made changes accordingly. We removed columns that had excess null values like the 'fastEight' column which had no entries for half of its entries. We also cleaned up the data by making a summary data frame and merging it with our main one. 

The analysis featured in this notebook sought to find correlation between ticket prices and the features offered by each ski resort. Typically there were positive correlations between price and resorts that had high vertical drops, high turnover rate for runs (total chairs and number of fast chairs), total area of skiable terrain, and the amount of snow per season. We used a heatmap to quickly identify factors that had a strong correlation with adult weekend lift ticket prices and we took a closer look at the trends using a scatterplot which allowed us to see the data point that creates the correlations. The graphs provided describes an agregate of all the resorts in America so when preseseting our findings, we should be cautious to limit our findings to within the great lake areas to keep pricing consistent with ther resorts in the area. We can limit our scope to more accurately represent our problem.
